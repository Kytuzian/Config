# Config

These are my dotfiles and such.

To use, run this (or clone and set it up manually):
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReedOei/Config/master/bin/setup-vim | bash
```

If you want to just use the vim stuff (though it will download everything), run this:

```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReedOei/Config/master/bin/setup-vim | bash
```

Then enter Vim and type

```
:PluginInstall
```

Then you're all good.
